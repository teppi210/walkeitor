I am implementing the ability to execute commands as
"Move the consumable from building A to building B"

Pointers:
  - GameManager / public void moveTo(final Unit unit, final TileLocatable tileLocatable, final AStarPathModifier.IAStarPathModifierListener pathModifierListener)

       Customized the PathModifierListener and used the Command pattern to execute the commands, but the unit is not moving at all in the screen.
       I am not sure why. Needs debug.


  - MoveToPrimitiveComamnd
  - GameManager moveTo(Unit unit, int posX, int posY)
  - Unit executeCommands
