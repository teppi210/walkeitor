I am implementing the ability to execute commands as
"Move the consumable from building A to building B"

Pointers:
  - GameManager / public void moveTo(final Unit unit, final TileLocatable tileLocatable, final AStarPathModifier.IAStarPathModifierListener pathModifierListener)

        Need to modify the A* algorithm to be able to find a close location if the final location
        is occupied.

  - MoveToPrimitiveComamnd
  - GameManager moveTo(Unit unit, int posX, int posY)
  - Unit executeCommands
