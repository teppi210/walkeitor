I am implementing the ability to execute commands as
"Move the consumable from building A to building B"

Pointers:
  - GameManager / public void moveTo(final Unit unit, final TileLocatable tileLocatable, final AStarPathModifier.IAStarPathModifierListener pathModifierListener)

        Need to modify the A* algorithm to be able to find a close location if the final location
        is occupied.

  - OccupiedTiles / getClosestFreeTile

        If the tile I am trying to move is occupied getClosestFreeTile will give me the closest free tile
        to my path.
